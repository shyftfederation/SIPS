# Shyft Improvement Proposals (SIPs)

**Before you initiate a pull request**, please read the [EIP-1](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1) process document. Ideas should be thoroughly discussed on [Ethereum Research](https://ethresear.ch/t/read-this-before-posting/8) or [Ethereum Magicians](https://ethereum-magicians.org/) first.

This repository tracks ongoing improvements to Ethereum. It contains:

- The [EIP status page](https://eips.ethereum.org), tracking protocols for Ethereum clients and applications
- The [process document](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1) that governs how protocols are published here

For help *implementing* an EIP, please visit [Ethereum Stack Exchange](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com).

## Mission

The goal of the EIP project is to document standardized protocols for Ethereum clients and applications and to document them in a high quality and implementable way.

## Preferred Citation Format

The canonical URL for a EIP that has achieved draft status at any point is at https://eips.ethereum.org/. For example, the canonical URL for EIP-1 is https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1.

Please consider anything which is not published on https://eips.ethereum.org/ as a working paper.

And please consider anything published at https://eips.ethereum.org/ with a status of "draft" as an incomplete draft.

## Automerger

This repository contains an "auto merge" feature to ease the workload for EIP editors. Pull requests to any EIP will be auto-merged if the EIP's authors approve the PR on GitHub. This is handled by the [EIP-Bot](https://github.com/ethereum/EIP-Bot).

## Validation

Pull requests in this repository must pass automated validation checks:

* HTML formatting and broken links are [checked](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/.travis-ci.sh) using [html-proofer](https://rubygems.org/gems/html-proofer).
* EIP front matter and formatting are [checked](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/.github/workflows/auto-merge-bot.yml) using [EIP Validator](https://github.com/ethereum/eipv).

It is possible to run the EIP validator locally:
```sh
cargo install eipv
eipv <INPUT FILE / DIRECTORY>
```
